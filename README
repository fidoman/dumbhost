Simple mailer that allows server to send mail through configured smarthost.
Nevertheless it maintains queue to keep mail in case of delivery failure.
To avoid spam explosions or eternal generating forward loops per-user send limits can be confugured.
Please set it accordingly with expected mail traffic bursts.
Minimal additional feature is local mail delivery.
Any advanced configuration may be implemented directly in the code.

Installation

Installator creates dumbhost.conf at /etc. Edit it.
  Default and per-user hourly limit
  Domain for outgoing mail
  Will all user share same name or use username for generating email
  Smarthost IP, port, username, password

sendmail script is placed as /usr/bin/sendmail. You must chown +s it and create symlink where needed
(for example /usr/lib/sendmail - where mail executable will get it)
Create mqueue directory (see config).
Create empty /etc/aliases if none exists.
Create history directory /var/dumbhost

TODO:
